       "     'doc': 'Lunch Talk On Future Of Self-driving Cars With Brad TempletonMarch 22, 2015On March 18th, Garage48 HUB had the pleasure to host Brad Templeton, an evangelist of self-driving cars who has been advising the Google Car project, from Silicon Valley.The lunch talk started at 13:00 with many people interested gathering to listen to Brad Templeton, a Networking and Computing Chair in Silicon Valley-based Singularity University, a board member (and former chairman) of Electronic Frontier Foundation and a director of the futurist Foresight Nanotech Institute speak about self-driving cars. Brad is\\nalso working with tens of companies related to self-driving cars and drones\\nspace. After his talk, the participants had great opportunity to ask\\nquestions to him.First, he\\ntalked about the current situation without self-driving cars. Did you know that\\n1.2 million people are killed by cars in the world and 5.5 billion hours are\\nlost on roads in the U.S. every year? The solution is self-driving cars.\\nComputer-driving is safer than human-driving and people will not need to kill\\ntheir productive time for driving anymore since computer will drive while\\npeople are doing their stuffs in cars.Self-driving\\ncars are happening not only in sci-fi movies but in the real world. Currently,\\nmany car companies such as Mercedes, BMW, Nissan, Toyota and Tesla are working\\non self-driving car projects. However, Google’s approach is different. Google\\nis making vehicle with no pedal or handle. Moreover, the self-driving cars will\\nbe able to refuel or charge and park itself without human’s help.So, how will\\nself-driving cars change the world? Brad gave some idea with self-driving cars.\\nBasically, not only rich people but everyone will benefit from self-driving\\ncars in the future. Please imaginewhen you want to go somewhere but you do not\\nhave a car, you can type the direction on an application and a self-driving car\\nwill pick you up and take you there. It is like Taxify or Uber but without\\ndrivers. Another possible usage is for delivery. You can get anything you want\\nin 30 minutes with self-driving car delivery services. You will not need to go\\nto buy stuff and carry it by yourself anymore.Well,\\nself-driving cars probably have to overcome some obstacles such as legal issues\\nand antagonistic feelings among people. Governments tend to ban everything,\\nhowever, in fact, some states in the U.S. have been backing self-driving car\\ntesting. Another obstacle is antagonistic feelings, which are rooted in the\\ncommon idea that people feel more fear of killed by robot than killed by human.\\nBrad believes that people can be convinced by being aware that many people are\\nkilled by human-driving cars nowadays and self-driving cars are safer.After his\\nlecture, there were many interesting questions from the participants and\\nanswers from Brad.Q: How will\\nself-driving cars deal with unpredictable motorcycles?Brad:\\nSelf-driving cars will not cause trouble as long as motorcycle drivers keep\\nlaw. So, motorcycle drivers have to deal with it.Q: How to\\nsolve unemployment led by automation?Brad: The workers\\nin industries such as transportation losing job is unavoidable. For example,\\nworkers in factories and peasants are replaced by machines in reality. But\\nthere are many books you can find, which say that robot will replace people’s\\njobs but they can find new jobs.Q: What has\\nGoogle done related to ethical issues in the past tests? What will self-driving\\ncar do, if it has to kill either an old lady or a school kid? Which will it\\nchoose to damage my one property or someone’s two properties?Brad: It is the\\nmost frequently asked question. This kind of situation has not happened so far.\\nIf it happens, then it means that the self-driving car already has done\\nsomething illegal like it drives too fast. Self-driving cars will follow the\\nlaw, so change the law and do not make program think such a philosophical\\nquestion. And when people are in such an extreme situation, they cannot follow\\nlaw and start panicking.Q: Have you\\nseen any reaction by car companies, which will be affected by self-driving\\ncars?Brad: Many car companies are a bit afraid of\\nGoogle because they have small research projects with small budgets. But, it\\nmust be good affection by Google.Q: Will\\nself-driving cars communicate each other?Brad: The\\nserver to share information from every self-driving cars is hard and\\nunreliable. And, the first self-driving car will be lonely. So, it can happen\\nlater but not in the early stage.Q: What is\\nGoogle’s business model with self-driving cars?Brad: I do not\\nknow and Google did not know at least when I was with them although they might\\nfind some good business models. The thing is that Google do not think about\\nbusiness but they are sure that they can make money from self-driving cars\\nbecause car and transportation industries are huge.I hope everyone enjoyed the lunch talk with pizza we prepared.\\nIf you forgot putting 0.5 EUR per one slice of pizza,to an empty bottle on the\\ntable, come to the next event and give it to someone from Garage48 HUB! Check\\nout his blog if you want to be more acquainted with self-driving technologies.'}},\n",

       "     'doc': 'Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet, has announced plans to put self-driving trucks on the streets of Atlanta. The trucks will carry cargo bound for Google\\'s data center. ( Waymo Team | Medium )Waymo has big news to share: next week, it will start testing self-driving trucks on the streets of Atlanta.The self-driving car unit of Google\\'s parent company, Alphabet, became a standalone division called Waymo back in 2016. It has made significant headway in the self-driving space since then, and the upcoming tests mark another important milestone.Waymo Self-Driving Trucks Headed To AtlantaIn a post published on Medium on Friday, March 9, Waymo announced that it will start a new pilot program next week in Atlanta, which will entail using a self-driving truck to deliver cargo to Google\\'s data center.Waymo says that it always planned to make it easy and safe to move around both people and things. If so far it has focused on people for the main part, now it wants to focus more on things.Last year, Google had the world\\'s first fleet of fully autonomous cars roaming the streets of Phoenix, Arizona. It has also started testing self-driving trucks in California and Arizona, and now it\\'s ready to move onto the next stage and test self-driving cars in Atlanta, to deliver things. Waymo is confident that self-driving tech has the potential to make trucking safer and better.Waymo\\'s Mission For Self-Driving Trucks\"Our software is learning to drive big rigs in much the same way a human driver would after years of driving passenger cars,\" says Waymo. \"The principles are the same, but things like braking, turning, and blind spots are different with a fully-loaded truck and trailer.\"The self-driving car unit further adds that Atlanta is one of the largest logistics hubs in the United States. It\\'s where Google carries out its logistics operations, and it\\'s ideal for Waymo\\'s next tests for self-driving trucks. The pilot program will kick off next week in Georgia.In collaboration with the logistics team at Google, this pilot program will enable Waymo to fine-tune its technology and implement it for shipping and carrying operations, complete with their factories network, ports, terminals, and distribution centers.Not Fully Self-Driving Just YetWaymo self-driving trucks will start roaming the highways of Atlanta, but they still require humans to be in the vehicle. Human drivers will be in the trucks\\' cabins at all times, monitoring the systems and ready to take control should anything go wrong.Lastly, Waymo adds that its self-driving trucks rely on the same technology, advanced software, and custom-built sensors as its self-driving minivan. The company says that its technology could enable various applications, from logistics to ride-hailing.'}},\n",

       "     'doc': \"MenuSelf Driving Rideshare Vehicles | How Soon Will We See Them?Self driving cars have long been a thing of epic sci-fi movies. When you ask someone to describe what they see the future looking like in 20 years, odds are self driving cars come up in the conversation.We've romanticized over the idea for years. Now all of a sudden this future is looking like it's a whole lot closer to becoming an immediate reality.Google has been testing self driving cars on the road since May of 2o15, the unmanned vehicles have covered more than 2 million miles. It's no secret that the big players in the rideshare industry want a slice of the pie. Both Lyft and Uber have announced plans to incorporate self driving vehicles into their business plan. But just how far out is self driving rideshare?But Just How Far Out is Self Driving Rideshare?It exists. Right now in Pittsburgh, self driving vehicles are giving Uber rides. The city is ground zero for a self driving test zone (Advanced Technologies Center) that was set up about a year and a half ago.It's not actually a full fledged self driving vehicle city, yet. Right now only a small portion of Uber vehicles are self driving cars. The rest of the vehicles are Uber X's with drivers and all the normal boring stuff you would expect in an Uber ride. Oh yeah, and the self driving vehicles come with a safety driver.So they're self driving, kind of. Uber hasn't actually unleashed the technology in its full self driving form just yet. Being that it's ground zero and this is all for testing, that's probably a good thing. One of the scenarios the self driving vehicles need a human override - bad weather. Apparently self driving vehicles handle weather problems as poorly as the rest of us.Ultimately, it's a huge step forward for Uber. They appear to be ahead of the game in self driving vehicles for rideshare. And they have a noble cause to go along with the technology - reduce human error and make the roads safer for all of us.Where is Lyft at in Self Driving Technology?In January of 2016 GM invested $500 million in Lyft. The partnership is heavily focused on one thing, self driving cars. GM had long shown interest in self driving technology, and Lyft is the perfect vehicle for that vision.It all sounds great, but Uber already has self driving cars giving Uber rides. So where is Lyft at?Days after Uber announced their self driving tests in Pittsburgh, Lyft president John Zimmer chimed in on Lyft's game plan.According to Zimmer, Lyft has a three phase plan for introducing self driving vehicles:Autonomous vehicles that operate on a fixed route (sometime in 2017)Self driving cars with a max speed of 25mph (around 2019)Fully functional self driving vehicles (2021-2022)Personally, I'm a big fan of the road map that Zimmer has laid out. It also makes a lot of sense. Early autonomous vehicle technology will very limited, fixed routes are the best way to minimize risk as the technology becomes more refined. With that said, Uber still has a leg up on Lyft being that they currently have autonomous vehicles on the road.What Hurdles Are Left for Autonomous Rideshare?The technology is awesome, I can't wait to hop in a self driving Lyft/Uber myself. But let's be realistic, there are still plenty of hurdles to come.Legislation: Since 2012, 17 states have brought up the autonomous vehicle debate. Only Florida, California, Nevada and Washington D.C. have put laws into place. There is a lot of lobbying ahead of Uber and Lyft, legislation may come with a hefty price tag.Lawsuits: It doesn't matter how much safer self driving vehicles are. The first autonomous vehicle caused accident will open the door for countless lawsuits. At this point, it's safe to say settlement funds have already been budgeted in for Uber and Lyft.Financing: Uber and Lyft are not capital intensive businesses, at least in theory. They provide an app and some insurance, then drivers bring their own vehicles and operate as independent contractors. It's a great business model. So how do self driving vehicles come into play? It's a huge capital investment with enormous maintenance expenses to follow. The cynical side of me wants to say it's all a ploy to increase their private valuation and bring in more investor money before an IPO - it all sounds kind of bubbly. But then again, that's why I'm here writing about it not out calling the shots.We've seen rideshare companies overcome huge hurdles in the past four or five years. Rideshare wasn't legal in a lot of states and cities, but Uber and Lyft went there anyways. They've fought legislation and won. They've fought driver lawsuits and won. A lot of people didn't think they'd replace the taxi industry - and then they did.If there's an express route to self driving vehicles, Uber and Lyft have the formula. It sounds like they're putting it into play a lot faster than we imagined.Get free gear!DisclaimerThis website is not owned or operated by the mentioned companies, we are not an extension of these companies.

For vehicles that allow a driver to switch between self-driven/automated and manually operated modes, a mechanism is needed that enables the vehicle to enforce self-driving modes on the appropriate portion(s) of the roads.The solution is a system built into the vehicle that detects the location of the self-driving vehicle, compares it to a database of known areas where only automated driving vehicles are allowed, and then takes the necessary actions to respect known restrictions.The system is composed of a computing device located within the vehicle that supports both manual and automated driving modes. The device has a database of the locations with mandatory self-driving mode operation. The database may be stored locally within the device or dynamically downloaded through a wireless communication mechanism.The self-driving vehicle can detect its location and compare it to the map or collection of self-driving roads to determine if it is allowed to use the road.

       "     'doc': 'SELF - DRIVING MACHINEAbstractDisclosed is a self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned above a conventional or substitute line and a lower roller positioned below the conventional or substitute line, wherein the self-driving machine is provided with a tension regulating unit for moving the lower roller contacted with the conventional or substitute line so as to control tension of the conventional or substitute line at a position between the pair of upper rollers.Full TextBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\\nField of the Invention\\nThe present invention relates to a self-driving machine for advancing a pulling rope and a guide rope when a conventional line or a substitute line is exchanged with the new line by means of a construction method using supporting rollers, and more particularly to a self-driving machine capable of regulating a tension of a conventional line or a substitute line and easily changing its direction without danger of fall.\\nDescription of the Related Art\\nGenerally, a self-driving machine installs a new line according to the following procedures. A guide rope and a pulling rope are connected to the self-driving machine, and a new line is connected to one end of the pulling rope. The self-driving machine connected to the guide rope and the pulling rope is controlled in a wireless manner and advances forward. When the self-driving machine is running, supporting rollers are arranged at regular intervals by means of the guide rope connected to the self-driving machine. These supporting rollers prevent the new line from being drooped excessively. If the self-driving machine runs from one power transmission tower to the next power transmission tower, the pulling rope is pulled by a tensioning machine, thereby completing installation of the new line.\\nHowever, the conventional self-driving machine is not provided with a device for controlling tension of a conventional line and a substitute line while it is running. Thus, once a worker manually controls tension of a wire (i.e., the conventional line and the substitute line) before the self-driving machine runs, there was no measures to control the tension. As mentioned above, the tension of the wire applied to upper and lower rollers is kept constant regardless of an angle at which the self-driving machine is running. As a result, the tension of the wire is not changed according to circumstances, thereby causing loss in a driving force of motor and abrasion of the upper and lower rollers.\\nIn addition, at a region suffered from strong wind such as river, cliff and hill, the self-driving machine is apt to depart from the wire and fall down due to the strong wind.\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\\nThe present invention is designed to solve the problems of the prior art, and therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a self-driving machine provided with a tension regulating unit so as to control tension of a wire supported by upper and lower rollers.\\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a self-driving machine capable of easily changing its direction by installing a direction-changing unit thereto.\\nStill another object of the present invention is to provide a self-driving machine provided with an anti-separation member so as to prevent a conventional line or a substitute line from departing from the upper roller to make the self-driving machine fallen.\\nIn order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned above a conventional or substitute line and a lower roller positioned below the conventional or substitute line, wherein the self-driving machine is provided with a tension regulating unit for moving the lower roller contacted with the conventional or substitute line so as to control tension of the conventional or substitute line at a position between the pair of upper rollers.\\nPreferably, the self-driving machine further includes a support member for rotatably supporting the lower roller, wherein the tension regulating unit includes a cylinder coupled to the support member to move the support member; and a motor for driving the cylinder.\\nMore preferably, the self-driving machine further includes a microprocessor for automatically controlling the tension of the conventional or substitute line.\\nIn addition, a force applied to the conventional or substitute line by the lower roller is preferably in the range of 2 to 10 kgf.\\nIn another aspect of the invention, there is provided a self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned above a conventional or substitute line, a lower roller positioned below the conventional or substitute line, and a timing belt connecting the pair of upper rollers, the self-driving machine including: an actuator; a driving bar having one end connected to the actuator; first and second sprockets respectively positioned above and below the timing belt and rotating in a predetermined direction; and\\nfirst and second movable rollers combined to both of the other ends of the driving bar respectively, wherein the first and second movable rollers are selectively contacted with the first and second sprockets to move the timing belt in a selected direction.\\nIn still another aspect of the invention, there is also provided a self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned above a conventional or substitute line and a lower roller positioned below the conventional or substitute line, the self-driving machine including: a plurality of anti-separation bars having one ends coupled to a frame of the self-driving machine to surround the pair of upper rollers installed to the frame; and an anti-separation plate coupled to the other ends of the plurality of anti-separation bars.\\nA self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned above a conventional or substitute line and a lower roller positioned below the conventional or substitute line, wherein the self-driving machine is provided with a tension regulating unit for moving the lower roller contacted with the conventional or substitute line so as to control tension of the conventional or substitute line at a position between the pair of upper rollers.\\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\\nOther objects and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawing in which:\\nFig. 1 is a perspective view showing a front portion of a self-driving machine according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention;\\nFig. 2 is a perspective view showing a rear portion of the self-driving machine according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;\\nFig. 3 is a sectional view showing an automatic tension regulating unit of the self-driving machine according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention; and\\nFigs. 4 and 5 are schematic diagrams illustrating operation of a direction-changing unit of a self-driving machine according to another embodiment of the present invention.\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT\\nHereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings. Prior to the description, it should be understood that the terms used in the specification and appended claims should not be construed as limited to general and dictionary meanings, but interpreted based on the meanings and concepts corresponding to technical aspects of the present invention on the basis of the principle that the inventor is allowed to define terms appropriately for the best explanation. Therefore, the description proposed herein is just a preferable example for the purpose of illustrations only, not intended to limit the scope of the invention, so it should be understood that other equivalents and modifications could be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.\\nFigs. 1 and 2 are perspective views showing a self-driving machine according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.\\nReferring to Figs. 1 and 2, the self-driving machine of the present invention includes a frame 10, a roller unit 20, a tension regulating unit 40, a direction-changing unit 80 and a self-charging battery 60.\\nThe roller unit 20 is positioned above the frame 10, and includes a pair of upper rollers 21 having driven sprockets 22, a driving sprocket for giving a driving force to the upper rollers 21, a timing belt 26 connecting the driven sprockets 22 of the upper rollers 21 to the driving sprocket, a lower roller 28 for giving tension to a conventional line or a substitute line together with the upper rollers 21, and a support member 29 for rotatably supporting the lower roller 28.\\nThe pair of upper rollers 21 are installed above the frame 10 with an interval between them, and the driven sprockets 22 are formed on their rear sides respectively.\\nThe driving sprocket is installed between the upper rollers 21 and connected to the driven sprockets 22 of the upper rollers 21 by means of the timing belt 26 to work together. The driving sprocket includes a first sprocket 24 and a second sprocket 25 that rotate clockwise and counterclockwise respectively to ensure bidirectional operation of the timing belt 26. The first and second sprockets 24, 25 are respectively positioned above and below the timing belt 26.\\nThe lower roller 28 is disposed at a lower position between the upper rollers 21 and gives tension to a conventional line or a substitute line together with the upper rollers\\n21. The lower roller 28 is rotatably supported by the support member 29 whose one end is pivotally mounted to the frame 10.\\nReferring to Fig. 3, the tension regulating unit 40 includes a tension motor 44, a reduction gear 46 for reducing a speed of the tension motor 44, and a cylinder 48 for selectively lifting up the support member 29, which supports the lower roller 28 to be rotatable, by means of a power passing through the reduction gear 46.\\nOne end of the support member 29 is pivotally installed to the frame 10, and the other end is pivotally combined with an end of a cylinder rod 49 of the cylinder 48.\\nIn case a weak tension is applied to the conventional line or the substitute line, the tension motor 44 and the reduction gear 46 moves the cylinder rod 49 upward so that the support member 29 that rotatably supports the lower roller 28 is lifted up. The cylinder rod 49 lifts up the support member 29 to make the lower roller 28 contacted with the upper rollers 21, thereby applying tension to the advancing conventional or substitute line.\\nIn case a strong tension is applied to the conventional line or the substitute line, the tension motor 44 and the reduction gear 46 moves the cylinder rod 49 downward so that the support member 29 that rotatably supports the lower roller 28 is moved downward. The cylinder rod 49 moves the support member 29 downward, so the lower roller 28 reduces the tension applied to the conventional line or the substitute line advancing in contact with the upper rollers 21.\\nThe lower roller 28 presses the conventional or substitute line by force of about 1 to 30 kgf, preferably 2 to 10 kgf. If the lower roller 28 presses the conventional or substitute line by force less than the minimum value, slip is generated not to give sufficient driving force. If the pressure of the lower roller 28 is greater than the maximum value, it may cause abrasion of the upper rollers 21 and the lower roller 28 and damage of the tension motor 44.\\nPreferably, the self-driving machine of the present invention is further provided with a microprocessor 42 for periodically obtaining a tension value of the conventional or substitute line and then controlling the tension regulating unit 40 to automatically control the tension. Since the microprocessor 42 automatically controls the tension, the upper\\nrollers 21 and the lower roller 28 are not slipped with respect to the conventional or substitute line and also not excessively worn away.\\nFigs. 4 and 5 shows a self-driving machine according to another embodiment of the present invention.\\nReferring to Figs. 4 and 5, the self-driving machine of this embodiment has a direction-changing unit 80 for changing a rotating direction of the upper rollers 21 from forward to rearward, or vice versa. The direction-changing unit 80 includes an actuator 82, a driving bar 84 having one end connected to the actuator 82, and movable rollers 86, 88 combined to both of the other ends of the driving bar 84.\\nIf the actuator 82 operates the driving bar 84 vertically, the first or second movable roller 86, 88 combined to the other ends of the driving bar 84 moves the timing belt 26 vertically. The vertically moving timing belt 26 is selectively contacted with the first sprocket 24 and the second sprocket 25, which rotate in a predetermined direction.\\nIf the actuator 82 operates the driving bar 84 downward, the first movable roller 86 pushes down the timing belt 26 to be contacted with the first sprocket 24. If the actuator 82 operates the driving bar 84 upward, the second movable roller 88 lifts up the timing belt 26 to be departed from the first sprocket 24 and contacted with the second sprocket 25. If the first sprocket 24 is contacted with the timing belt 26, the self-driving machine moves forward, while, if the second sprocket 25 is contacted with the timing belt 26, the self-driving machine moves rearward.\\nMeanwhile, as shown in Fig. 1, the self-driving machine of the present invention is provided with an anti-separation member 90 so as to prevent the upper roller 21 from departing from the conventional or substitute line to make the self-driving machine fallen down.\\nThe anti-separation machine 90 includes a plurality of anti-separation bars 92 having one ends coupled to the frame 10 to surround the pair of upper rollers 21 combined to the frame 10, and an anti-separation plate 94 coupled to the other ends of the plurality of anti-separation bars 92. Thus, the conventional or substitute line departing from the upper rollers 21 due to the strong wind at a region such as river, cliff and hill is hooked to the anti-separation member 90, so the self-driving machine is not fallen down.\\nThe self-charging battery 60 is self-charged while the self-driving machine is running, and it is used when starting the self-driving machine or turning on a receiver. That is to say, the self-charging battery 60 enables a worker to start, stop, restart, accelerate or decelerate the self-driving machine by using a wireless transceiver. The receiver is built in the self-driving machine, and at least two transceivers are employed. At a long distance, one worker controls a self-driving machine and then another worker controls the same self-driving machine successively. At this time, a frequency band of 2.4 GHz is used to prevent any confusion with frequencies of the corona discharge that is generated in a high-voltage cable. An electric wave range is 3 km to the maximum in consideration of the worst conditions such as river and cliff. Double heterodyne is used as a receiving manner, which is digitally controlled. The self-charging battery 60 preferably uses DC 12V.\\nThe present invention has been described in detail. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.\\nAPPLICABILITY TO THE INDUSTRY\\nAs described above, the self-driving machine of the present invention gives the following effects.\\nFirst, since the automatic tension regulating unit equipped with a microprocessor is provided, tension applied to the upper and lower rollers may be automatically controlled, thereby preventing slip or excessive abrasion of the rollers.\\nSecond, the direction-changing unit provided to the self-driving machine facilitates easy change of direction of the self-driving machine.\\nThird, the anti-separation member prevents the self-driving machine from falling down when the conventional or substitute line departs from the upper rollers.We claim:-\\n1. A self-driving machine, which includes a pair of upper rollers positioned\\nabove a conventional or substitute line and a lower roller positioned below the\\nconventional or substitute line,\\ncharacterized in that: the self-driving machine is provided with a tension regulating unit 40 for moving the lower roller contacted with the conventional or substitute line so as to control tension of the conventional or substitute line at a position between the pair of upper rollers;\\nwherein the lower roller is moved by the tension regulation unit to press the conventional or substitute line\\n2.

Yesterday, the companies made it official.This is the first time that Google has partnered directly with an automaker to integrate their autonomous tech into a vehicle.The deal will see FCA build 100 specially prepared Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid vans that will be sent over to Google where they'll get to have autonomous hardware and software fitted. Both companies will share a facility near FCA's headquarters in Auburn Hills, MI.This group of vans will be used for testing purposes and double Google's test fleet from 100 to 200 vehicles. Now the deal is non-exclusive to both parties. It is also unknown if this deal is a one-off or could lead to something more.“The opportunity to work closely with FCA engineers will accelerate our efforts to develop a fully self-driving car that will make our roads safer and bring everyday destinations within reach for those who cannot drive,” said John Krafcik, Chief Executive Officer, Google Self-Driving Car Project.FCA engineers to work alongside Google engineers to integrate self-driving technology into vehicleSelf-driving cars have the potential to make our roads safer and make transportation more accessible for millions of peopleMay 3, 2016 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - The Google Self-Driving Car Project and FCA announced today, in a first-of-its-kind collaboration, that they will integrate Google’s self-driving technology into all-new 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to expand Google’s existing self-driving test program. This marks the first time that Google has worked directly with an automaker to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software, into a passenger vehicle.The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans will be used later this year for Google’s self-driving testing, more than doubling Google’s current fleet of self-driving test vehicles. Engineering responsibilities will be shared based on each company’s respective expertise. FCA will initially design and engineer around 100 vehicles uniquely built for Google’s self-driving technology. Google will integrate the suite of sensors and computers that the vehicles will rely on to navigate roads autonomously.Both companies will co-locate part of their engineering teams at a facility in southeastern Michigan to accelerate the design, testing and manufacturing of the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica.“FCA has a nimble and experienced engineering team and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan is well-suited for Google’s self-driving technology,” said John Krafcik, Chief Executive Officer, Google Self-Driving Car Project. “The opportunity to work closely with FCA engineers will accelerate our efforts to develop a fully self-driving car that will make our roads safer and bring everyday destinations within reach for those who cannot drive.”Self-driving cars have the potential to prevent some of the 33,000 deaths that occur each year on U.S. roads, 94 percent of which are caused by human error. This collaboration will help FCA and Google better understand what it will take to bring self-driving cars into the world.“Working with Google provides an opportunity for FCA to partner with one of the world’s leading technology companies to accelerate the pace of innovation in the automotive industry,” said Sergio Marchionne, Chief Executive Officer, FCA. “The experience both companies gain will be fundamental to delivering automotive technology solutions that ultimately have far-reaching consumer benefits.”Google’s self-driving cars are currently being tested in four U.S. cities. The self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans will be tested by Google’s self-driving car team on its private test track in California prior to operating on public roads.Share on other sitesShare this commentLink to commentShare on other sitesIf they could come up with a fully autonomous Pacifica that would be pretty sweet.

       "     'doc': 'Self-Driving Cars Are Coming – But First, 5 Issues Need FixingCompanies like Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been hard at work creating self-driving cars. A new report from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on the coming shift in the auto world promises that the vehicles will be on the road sooner than people realize, and has a look at the problems that the technology is going to face in its first years.According to the report self-driving cars could save the U.S. economy an estimated $1.3 trillion each year. Getting cars to drive themselves will be the “easy part” according to the analysts. Cars that can operate some of their own functions are set to arrive in the next 12-18 months according to the report. Self-driving cars are going to change the way the world works.Self-driving car technologyThere are a few kinks to work out from an investment perspective. The view of the analysts is that the technology will work, it is on the way, and investors need not worry about it apart from preparing for its introduction.“The uncertainty around timelines of adoption for most new technologies in the auto industry is largely due to having to solve complex technological problems. That is not the case for autonomous vehicles—the technology to make a self- driving car happen is largely available today and only incremental R&D is required,” according to the analysts.The auto industry has been slow to adopt technology in recent decades. There is more impetus than ever for innovation right now, however. Companies like Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) have shown that there is value in a different type of car, and companies like Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) are circling. Auto companies are scared that self-driving cars are the next big thing. They can’t afford to miss out. That means self-driving cars are coming.Self-driving car problemsThe major issue around self-driving cars is liability, according to the analysts. In a car crash involving a self-driving car, whose fault is the crash? Insurance companies and the firms designing and selling self-driving cars will need to decide what happens in those situations.The liability issue is one of the most important problems facing the self-driving car, and it is one that will have to be solved before the cars are ever allowed on the market. If the responsibility for a crash is taken away from drivers, insurance prices could fall, but those costs would be moved to the companies making or supplying the vehicles.Global delivery is a second problem that the industry will have to confront if it wants to put the self-driving car at the forefront of transport. The Morgan Stanley analysts are strict in their belief that self-driving cars need to penetrate the emerging and developed world if they are to be successful.Consumer adoption will be difficult for self-driving cars. As the industry eases into the technology and a vehicle takes a small amount of control from the driver at a time the change is hoped to be easier, but people only buy a new car every few years. If the vehicles are around by 2020, people who bought a normal car in 2014 could be in for a big change.Side-by-side with consumer adoption is legislature adoption. The cars will need to be specifically legalized in every jurisdiction before they will be allowed on the roads. Building the popular and political support for that adaption may be difficult because certain powerful industries have vested interests in a static auto industry.The fifth big issue with self-driving cars is an ethical one. The vehicle will likely never be able to address every situation that a human driver can, and some situations may require illegal or illogical responses that human drivers are comfortable with. Once self-driving cars become the norm, situations like these may cost human lives. The net lives saved will be in the positive, but it will not change the fact that a self-driving car caused harm.Self-driving cars are on the way. It is for the companies involved in their manufacture and the governments involved in their regulation to decide how to deal with the five big problems. The Morgan Stanley analysts are sure that they will be able to, but investors will need to watch those decisions in order to make returns off of the introduction of self-driving cars.'}},\n",

The tie up comes as both ridesharing companies and carmakers are struggling to establish themselves as top players in the burgeoning world of self-drivings, seen as the future of the auto industry. Beneath the conditions of the alliance, Daimler intends to introduce high-class self-driving vehicles. In a joint statement, the firms said on the world-wide ridesharing network in the forthcoming years, of Uber. The deal will see Daimler manage and construct self-driving Mercedes Benz automobiles to be used by Uber, but no fiscal details were shown…Nissan has always been a pioneer for new technology. Now their plan is to start playing “for real” with self-drivings. Nissan has declared that it will start real world tests of self-driving cars in London next month – the first self-driving car test on the road ever in Europe. The demonstrations allows passengers to go through the self-driving systems that are expected to appear initially on Leaf and the Qashqai. Passengers include security and technical specialists, and government representatives, who’ll be in a position to see how a self-driving car acts in an extensive variety of urban surroundings that are driving – in this instance in a modified Nissan Leaf. The…Self-Driving Car Technology will definitely have an Impact on drivers and giants of the on-demand taxi business. Uber and Lyft, started to work on this technology plus they’re ready to introduce self-driving taxis in the future. Lyft has worked with General Motors to develop a fleet of driverless vehicles that may pick and fall passengers at their screen touches and leave the motorists out of work. Drivers are quite worried about it approach since the taxi cab companies may deviate from what they’re doing nowadays. Taxi drivers are usually better drivers than others.

       "     'doc': \"What can we expect with self-driving cars?On behalf of Robinson Salyers, PLLC posted in personal injury on Tuesday, September 27, 2016.If one is to believe news reports, self-driving, or driverless cars could be on American roads within the next five to 10 years. While these estimates may be overly optimistic, the fact remains that both domestic and foreign automakers are investing millions in this technology. In addition, Google and transportation companies such as Lyft and Uber are also making substantial investments in self-driving technology. Recently the federal government released safety guidelines for self-driving vehicles. Despite these investments, while self-driving cars may be the future, they are not the present.Self-driving cars are not foolproof. Yet.In order for self-driving cars to take over the roads, they will need to perform nearly flawlessly to ensure the safety of passengers, pedestrians and others on the road. While prototype self-driving cars have performed relatively well on the roads, they have caused accidents. In February, a Google self-driving car hit the side of a bus. Thankfully, no one was hurt. In May, a person riding in a Tesla self-driving car was killed when the vehicle hit a semi-truck. According to Tesla, the vehicle's Autopilot function confused the white side of a truck with the sun. Other Tesla Autopilot deaths have occurred in China and the Netherlands.Those in favor of self-driving cars cite the fact that human error is the cause of 95% of motor vehicle accidents. It is likely that self-driving cars would cut down on the number of injuries and fatalities. With this said, people aren't going to want to buy or use self-driving cars unless they can be certain that these vehicles will be safe.In the next few years, it will be worth watching to see whether self-driving vehicles become a major part of our lives. In the meantime, drivers who are distracted or otherwise negligent continue to cause harmful or fatal accidents. Following a car accident, it is important to work with attorneys who are fully invested in your success.

The car it cut off was a self-driving test vehicle from Delphi, a Tier-1 automotive supplier developing its own technology just down the road from Google.Reuters\\' source for the story was John Absmeier, the director of Delphi Labs in Mountain View. Absmeier was riding in his company\\'s test car when the close encounter with the Google car occurred. Reuters quotes Absmeier as saying the Delphi car \"took appropriate action,\" and the cars did not actually collide.While it\\'s true that Delphi and Google are competing to develop self-driving technology, Absmeier would have no reason to embellish this story to make his own company look better. Both cars are collecting scads of driving data, which could easily be consulted if there were any question. Also, Google just started issuing monthly reports on incidents involving its self-driving cars. According to Reuters, Google declined to comment on Absmeier\\'s story.Why this matters: Google\\'s self-driving car project will go on, but with a small dent to its dignity. This news has emerged a scant day after Google proudly announced the debut of its latest self-driving car--the cute little bug-shaped car, not one of the retrofitted Lexus cars--on Mountain View streets. Google\\'s publicity photo for that car showed it driving on what appears to be the same street, San Antonio Road, where the Google-Delphi dust-up took place.

       "     'doc': \"An autonomous stretchGoogle launched the first self driving car in 20th October 2015 credit@Google.AlphabetIt was October 20th, 2015 when the world’s first self-driving car took its debut voyage. The journey was conducted by Google’s Waymo project and was a simple test as the vehicle travelled from a local doctor’s office to a nearby park. The passenger was a blind man by the name of Steve Martin and when the car reached its destination, Steve Martin became the first person to ride in a self-driving car on public roads. This historical moment also marked the first time Steve Martin was alone in a car in 12 years. Google’s Waymo project implemented software and sensor technology developed in Google’s lab since 2009. With safety at the core of Google’s Waymo Project, the team set out to create an autonomous vehicle capable of making calculated decisions. To achieve safety through self-driving cars, Google built their self-driving car to use technology which is designed to detect pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles and road works in a 360-degree field of vision.Fitted with advanced cameras, Google’s self-driving car may detect objects on the road with, including details like a cyclist extending their arm. This information is processed by the vehicle and it may react accordingly, slowing or making room for a cyclist to pass if necessary. Since driving seems to be about processing information and making informed decisions based on external input, Google have fitted their cars with several sensory inputs; 3D digital maps are used, which include lane markers and traffic signals, cameras, lasers and 360 degrees lasers, which allow Google’s self-driving car to pinpoint its location day or night.All this technology means Google’s self-driving cars may be equipped to recognise and respond to various scenarios, including anticipating how others might behave. The programming behind this self-driving car ensures the vehicle navigates roads conservatively, slowing when required or granting extra room to cyclists. To help their self-driving car handle different scenarios, Google’s self driving cars have driven over two million miles on public roads and across four U.S. cities. In 2016, Google was able to capture and process over 1 billion miles of simulated driving. As the vehicles learn to adapt to new scenarios, Google aim to deploy more self-driving cars and to date, there are around 60 vehicles being testing on public roads. This adaptive philosophy may see the various self-driving prototypes testing in new ways as the programming continues to improve with each scenario.From Google’s self-driving debut, proving the possibility of self-driving cars, several other manufacturers have announced they aim to enter the field of vehicle autonomy and develop their own prototypes. With the possibility of autonomous vehicles becoming a reality, manufacturers like Volvo have announced they aim to have 100 self driving cars on the road in 2017. Companies like Uber already have functioning self driving cars models too, while manufacturers may still be at work perfecting their first prototypes.Outside of car manufacturers, technology-focused companies like Intel have already expanded their product line to innovate with self-driving technology. It may be several years before consumers get to sit in their first self-driving car, yet this field seems to be expanding as more companies invest in the concept. With several prototypes in circulation, it might be common to see more cars on public roads with 360-degree camera rigs attached to the roof. Whether helping those with disabilities travel or improving safety by making cars which adapt and prioritise safety, the technology industry seems to be making a large push toward self-driving cars.Holographic technology is a concept which seems to be straight from science fiction the way it projects 3D light … moreCOMMENTSthe Jupital welcomes a lively and courteous discussion in the comment section.

       "     'doc': \"Tennessee's self-driving industry needs competitionA new poll from AAA finds that Americans fear riding in a self-driving car, or even alongside one.\\nBuzz60Power and influence are fickle at the Tennessee state Capitol. More than 600 companies and 450 lobbyists registered as of Jan. 18, with many more expected to do so as the legislative session ramps up after Gov. Bill Haslam's State of the State address.(Photo: Fiel / AP)At the beginning of every industry — from light bulbs and telephones, to railroads and automobiles — there is a huge boom in testing, experimentation, research, marketing, and most importantly, competition.Today, one of the newest innovations is the self-driving car, and the burgeoning industry is seeing a similar boom in investment, development and innovation. At this nascent time in the self-driving industry, what companies can compete where will be crucial to the development and future of the self-driving vehicle.We feel one company is trying to rig the system by forcing through legislation that would only permit auto manufacturers to test and develop self-driving in Tennessee. This legislation, known as the SAVe Act (SB 151/HB 381) and sponsored by state Sen. Mark Green, R-Clarksville and Rep. William Lamberth, R-Cottontown, would effectively shut the door on technology companies like Uber, Lyft and Waymo from testing in Tennessee and cities across the state.Both traditional auto manufacturers and companies with deep technical expertise are strongly committed to the safety potential offered by self-driving vehicles.In 2015, more than 950 people died on Tennessee’s highways and roads. This is a crisis not just limited to Tennessee. Last year, more than 40,000 Americans died in car crashes according to estimates from the National Safety Council.These tragic statistics are the reason why both auto and tech companies are investing research, manpower and development into self-driving programs. Human error is the cause of approximately 94 percent of all crashes. By removing humans from the driving process entirely, self-driving vehicles can drastically improve safety in Tennessee’s cities, neighborhoods and on interstate highways.Yet the SAVe Act would only limit and delay the progress of self-driving by excluding tech companies from participating in the market. Delays in self-driving development will mean delays in the deployment of this life-saving technology not just in Tennessee, but nationwide.Faced with rising traffic deaths, we simply can’t afford to hold back innovation in self-driving vehicles.Competition drives the pace of innovation forward, collectively urging all the industry players to be safer and to be better. Tennessee should remain an open market welcome to all companies.This is a brand-new industry and lawmakers should support policies that allow the market and consumers to choose which companies and models are preferred.Many Tennessee lawmakers have indicated they want to encourage the self-driving industry to come to the state, bringing jobs and investment. They are also eager to see self-driving benefits extended to Tennesseans, including improved public safety, enhanced mobility, reduced congestion, and improved productivity.As currently written, the SAVe Act would serve only to discourage and disincentivize companies from bringing self-driving to the state.Self-driving cars are no longer a “figment of imagination,” and it’s exciting to see new entrants like Waymo, Uber and Lyft alongside traditional companies like Ford and Volvo working on this transformative technology. Together, these companies all recognize and value that competition spurs innovation.The self-driving industry -- automakers and technology companies alike -- want to come to Tennessee to test, develop, and ultimately commercially deploy. They want to make Tennessee’s neighborhoods safer and improve mobility for residents.But to do that, the state must remain open and pro-competition, welcome to all.David Strickland is counsel of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets and former NHTSA Administrator (2010-2014), where he issued the first-ever automated vehicle policy.

       "     'doc': 'First Ever US Legislation on Self-Driving Cars Comes to the HouseIn BriefUS lawmakers vote this week on a proposal to allow automakers to get up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles on the road without additional state-level regulation. This is a recognition of the need to save lives as traffic fatalities increase annually.A U.S. House panel will vote this Wednesday, July 19 on a proposal to allow automakers to release up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles onto the road. The measure would allow automakers to sell self-driving cars that have been proven to “function as intended and contain fail safe features” without being burdened by either additional driverless car rules at the state level or a duty to meet existing auto safety standards.The move, if it is successful, will be the first major federal legislation designed to hasten self-driving cars to market. It would not require pre-market approval of self-driving technologies, although it would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to federal regulators.Image Credit: Grendelkhan/Wiki CommonsIn other words, the technology would need to be proven safe initially through safety reports, but self-driving cars would not be lost in a thicket of state regulations. States could also still set rules on insurance, liability, licensing, registration, and safety inspections, but could not individually set performance standards for self-driving cars.This proposal is a recognition of the urgency of getting self-driving cars on our roads. US road deaths rose to 35,200 in 2015, a whopping 7.7 percent higher than the previous year, the biggest jump in a single year since 1966. Self-driving cars will save lives, as experts acknowledge, and this is the underlying motivation of the measure.'}},\n",

       "     'doc': 'Crash Rates Lower for Self-Driving Cars: Virginia Tech StudyCrash rates for self-driving cars are lower than the national crash rate of conventional cars, according to a new report out of Virginia Tech Transportation Institute that was commissioned by self-driving car developer Google.While self-driving cars have a rate of 3.2 crashes per million of miles, traditional driver-operated cars have a rate of 4.2 crashes per million miles, according to the study that adjusted the data for unreported crashes and takes into account accident severity.The authors note that the data also suggest that conventional vehicles may have higher rates of more severe crashes than self-driving cars, but there is insufficient data to draw this conclusion with strong confidence given the small overall number of crashes for the self-driving cars.However, there is “statistically-significant data that suggest less severe events may happen at significantly lower rates for self-driving cars” than conventional vehicles, according to the authors.Additionally, the research report notes of the data used, none of the vehicles operating in autonomous mode were deemed at fault.Up until now, comparisons based on existing data have been incomplete as requirements in each state for police reported crashes differ, and the majority of severe crashes that go unreported, not the authors. Meanwhile, self-driving cars are required to report every crash, no matter how minor. Thus previous studies have attempted to analyze self-driving car data, which has a full record of all crashes, relative to the current vehicle fleet, which has an incomplete record of crashes. “The comparison is, as the old saying goes, apples to oranges,” the authors state.To better estimate existing crash rates, the new report, Automated Vehicle Crash Rate Comparison Using Naturalistic Data, examines national crash data as well as data from naturalistic driving studies that closely monitors the on-road experience of 3,300 vehicles driving more than 34 million vehicle miles. It then compares the results to data from Google’s Self-Driving Car program, which includes written reports, video and vehicle kinematic data that deals with the motion of objects.The study was conducted by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute but sponsored by Google. The report includes a disclaimer that its final opinions and conclusions are those of the institute and not necessarily those of Google.A January 2015 study from the University of Michigan and the Sustainable Worldwide Transportation consortium of researchers said that it is not clear that a self-driving vehicle would ever perform more safely than an experienced, middle-aged driver and that during the transition period when conventional and self-driving vehicles would share the road, safety might actually worsen, at least for the conventional vehicles. However, the researchers noted two important caveats to its work: self-driving cars have traveled far few miles (1.2 million) than conventional cars ((3 trillion) and self-driving cars have been in less challenging (no snowy) road conditions, therefore their exposure is not yet representative of that for conventional vehicles.The Michigan researchers found that accident rates are higher for self-driving cars on the road with regular cars, although driverless vehicles have never been at fault. The driverless cars are usually hit from behind in slow-speed crashes by humans unaccustomed to machine motorists that always follow the rules and proceed with caution. The Michigan study also found that the severity of injuries in self-driving car crashes is lower than it is in crashes involving conventional vehicles.'}},\n",

       "     'doc': 'Tag Archives: Apple CarWhat it is: Self-driving promise greater mobility, but their multiple sensors have a weakness; they need to be cleaned regularly.Every new form of technology has unintended consequences. When smartphones started to appear, people started relying more on their smartphone and less on their PCs to do tasks like instant messaging or getting driving directions. That’s because it was easier to use a smartphone since most people have their smartphone with them at all times and don’t always have access to a PC at all times. Of course the problem with smartphones is that people stare at the screen and walk into walls, traffic or off the edges of sidewalks.With the coming self-driving car revolution, there’s a huge drawback. Self-driving cars can only work using multiple sensors to detect other cars, pedestrians and obstacles in the road such as construction detours or junk that has fallen off a truck into the road. For self-driving cars to work, those sensors need to be kept clean so dust and dirt doesn’t obscure the camera or sensor lens, creating a false reading from the sensor. Think of snowbound areas like Minnesota or North Dakota where snow can cover an entire car and the road, making a self-driving car literally blind.For optimum use, self-driving car sensors need to be kept clean, and that requires constant maintenance. A dirty self-driving car risks having dirt cover up a crucial sensor. Rain, sleet, hail, or snow risks blinding a self-driving car’s sensor altogether. If a sensor can detect other cars, the road, or obstacles, that self-driving car will be driving blind and risk crashing into objects.That means self-driving cars may be limited by foul weather, which makes them relatively useless in areas that experience such changes in weather from rain and snow to sleet and fog. Ultimately, that means self-driving cars still have a long way to go. Instead of waiting for self-driving cars, it’s far simpler to rely on assisted driving technology that essentially uses self-driving technology but in conjunction with a human driver.Already today’s cars have cameras in the back to help you back up and avoid obstacles. Assisted driving technology will automatically brake to avoid collisions and provide aid to drivers in other ways such as alerting them to obstacles int he road or warning them when another car may be getting too close.Assisted driving technology is the stepping stone to self-driving cars int he same way that hybrid cars are the stepping stone to pure electric cars. To make the leap to self-driving cars is impossible and untrustworthy. To rely on assisted driving technology that gets smarter and adapts to foul weather is far more likely and much safer.Such a simple thing as cleaning a lens can make the difference between success or failure in a self-driving car. Until sensors get smarter at dealign with dirt and foul weather, expect self-driving cars to remain a niche product like electric cars of today. Self-driving cars are coming. They’re just not ready to take over the highways just yet.What it is: Self-driving cars will literally change the way society lives within a few decades.Every new form of technology changes society. The printing press made reading and distribution of information affordable. The telephone eliminated telegraphs and the need for Morse code. The personal computer helped kill typewriters and adding machines along with eliminating typing pools in large companies.Perhaps the biggest change coming soon will be self-driving cars. For ease of maintenance, self-driving cars will rely on electric or other forms of power rather than gasoline. That immediately jeopardizes gas stations and car mechanics trained to repair combustion engines. Self-driving ride-sharing services will kill the taxi industry along with the auto industry, not to mention the oil industries that feed oil to large numbers of vehicles.Air pollution from cars will be reduced and as more people have time to relax rather than drive, they’ll have more free time to watch movies, read books, or listen to the radio, so those industries should increase. Of course, people will also play more video games or just use their computers while riding to work, much like people do today while riding trains.Mass transit will be another casualty. Why take mass transit when a self-driving car can take you exactly where you want to go? Buses will likely lose riders along with light rail trolley systems just starting to gain popularity in many cities. People will likely rely on mass transit for long distance but ride-sharing for short distances.Truck drivers will largely be replaced by self-driving trucks. With so much change on the horizon, it’s obvious that the future is coming. The only question is when?if you’re currently in a business that relies on today’s gasoline powered cars, it’s time to look for alternatives. Whether you’re a car sales person, mechanic, taxi driver, or gas station owner, your future is in jeopardy. The smart people will make plans now while they have plenty of time to adjust.m Most people will simply ignore the future until they can’t ignore it any longer, and then it will be too late.Don’t be like the masses that blissfully ignore the future and then complain when it finally arrives. (Think of coal miners waiting for their jobs to come back.) Self-driving cars will revolutionize the future so make plans now to be one of the winners instead of the large numbers of people who will lose and whine for the past to come back and magically make their lives back to the way they’re used to. It’s not going to happen and it never will. If you still think so, then try starting a company making slide rulers or repairing typewriters to see how far you’ll get.What it is: Apple and other companies are researching self-driving cars, but the first step will be assisted-driving.Google, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and practically every big auto maker has been touting their research into self-driving cars. The problem with self-driving cars is that it requires a huge step to go from driving cars ourselves to trusting computers to drive cars for us. As numerous accidents with self-driving cars show, self-driving car technology is still evolving. While it may be possible to ride safely in a self-driving car, the data needed to help self-drving cars navigate safely is still lacking.Combine the early research of self-driving cars with customer reluctance to turn over driving duties to a computer and you can see that self-driving cars aren’t going to suddenly pop up and displace traditional cars any more than electric cars will suddenly displace gasoline powered cars.The transition from gas engines to electric engines is through hybrids. This gives people the best of both worlds for now with electric power working with gas availability to insure that hybrids use less gas than traditional cars but have longer range than electric cars.So what’s likely to occur in the near future isn’t the giant leap from traditional cars to self-driving cars, but from traditional cars to assisted-driving cars. In other words, people will still need to drive cars but computers can assist them and warn them of dangers. If the driver fails to slow down in time to avoid an accident, assisted-driving technology can step in and slam on the brakes automatically.Assisted-driving technology is nearly identical to self-driving technology but with the driver still in control. Assisted-driving technology will simply make the transition smoother for the general public still suspicious of self-driving cars. In the meantime, assisted-driving technology can still collect crucial driving data to get “smarter” about driving. Just as cruise control lets drivers avoid pressing down on the accelerator themselves, so will assisted-driving technology allow drivers to hand off tedious aspects of driving to computers.This will allow more data collection on real driving conditions while also improving safety. Seat belts and air bags protect passengers, but assisted-driving technology can help drivers avoid accidents in the first place by braking automatically or alerting drivers when obstacles are too close such as other vehicles. Many accidents occur when drivers simply fail to see danger such as a motorcycle coming from the blind side or another car suddenly running a stop sign or red light.Assisted-driving technology can spot such dangers in night, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. Even during clear, sunny days, people often miss dangers around them, which is where assisted-driving technology can alert a driver and help avoid an accident. When people trust assisted-driving technology more and more, it will be an easy step to transition to self-driving cars.So don’t look for self-driving cars to magically appear overnight any more than expecting electric cars to suddenly dominate the roads. Today, you see mostly gas powered cars with a lot of hybrids and far fewer electric cars. Tomorrow you can expect to see traditional cars with many more sporting assisted-driving technology and a handful being completely autonomous self-driving cars.The self-driving car future is coming, but the path to that future will be through assisted-driving technology first.It’s easy to look ahead to the future. Netflix originally started as a business mailing DVDs back and forth to customers rs, but they knew eventually the future would be streaming video. Apple could see that the future was streaming video as well, which is why they refused to put Blu-ray disc drives in the Macintosh. Apple also saw the demise of the flop disk long before PC makers did. By simply imagining the future, you can avoid lots of problems clinging to the past like Kodak, Blockbuster Video, or Sears.At one time, people rented tapes and then DVDs from Blockbuster Video. Redbox appeared with vending machines all over the city, which undercut Blockbuster Video’s prices and monopoly on video rentals. Now Redbox is dying from streaming video.Using this as a baseline, it’s not hard to see what the future of self-driving cars will be. Uber is already looking towards a future where they won’t need to hire drivers any more. Instead, Uber will consist of self-driving cars that come to where you are and then take you where you need to go. From Uber’s point of view, this means self-driving cars will eliminate the need for paying drivers. The future of self-driving cars is inherently linked to ride-sharing services.Competing in this market are technology companies like Google and Apple, and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. There are also the car makers like Volvo and Ford experimenting with self-driving cars because everyone knows that’s the future. Out of the three competitors for the self-driving car market, someone has to make cars but chances are it won’t be the Big Three auto makers. Right now, their current business model depends on car sales and ride-sharing threatens to lower car ownership. The Big Three auto makers are also slow in shifting to clean energy cars like electric. While electricity still needs to be generated to run electric cars, electric cars don’t pollute.With auto makers saddled with the past, they’ll likely get left behind in the self-driving car market as a bit player. That leaves the technology companies and the ride-sharing companies. They need each other because the technology companies can keep improving their self-driving technology while the ride-sharing services use them to create a fleet of taxis roaming the streets. Right now the ride-sharing services absolutely depend on the technology companies to hail cars using a smartphone, either Android or the iPhone. Beyond that, customers just want a car.Now here’s where the competition heats up. The technology companies want to create the safest self-driving cars, but they also want to create an entertainment center inside that car. For example, if you subscribe to Apple Music, you’ll be able to link your smartphone to the self-driving car’s stereo to play your music through the car’s speakers. Most likely, whatever Apple offers, Google will copy and vice versa, but you can see how self-driving taxis will need to cater to both Android and the iPhone.So who will literally be in the driver’s seat when self-driving taxis become a reality and commonplace? Believe it or not, it will probably be the ride-sharing services because they have the customers and know how to reach them. The technology companies want to get their technology on the road to gather more data and learn, but they don’t have access to the customers without the ride-sharing services. That means the ride-sharing services will be in control and the technology companies will simply make money a different way, such as by displaying ads with Google or providing a unique riding experience to convince you to buy Apple’s services like Apple Music.The technology companies are replaceable. The ride-sharing companies are not. That means it’s likely ride-sharing companies will be much like the Android vs. iOS competition. IN the US this boils down to Lyft vs. Uber. In other parts of the world, there will likely be two rivals in the ride-sharing market as well. If one company dominates, they won’t have the incentive to compete, but if two or three compete, then service and prices will be better for everyone in much the same way that most countries have multiple cellular companies competing for customers.So expect technology companies like Tesla, Google, and Apple to compete with self-driving car technology and ride-sharing services to compete with each other like Lyft vs. Uber. The current car makers? If Tesla can build their own cars without the help of the Big Three, then the Big Three auto makers have little future to control their own fate. The future is ride-sharing services and technology companies.What it is: Ride-sharing services and self-driving cars will likely lead to a reduction of car ownership.At one time, the Big Three auto makers in Detroit made and sold most of the cars in the world. If you didn’t like what Detroit made, tough. You had no choice. Then other countries started making quality cars and importing them into America. Suddenly the Big Three auto makers had to compete and they failed miserably once cheaper, better built, and more fuel-efficient imports from Toyota, Honda, and others showed that people wanted something other than what the Big Three auto makers were offering.Now that the Big Three auto makers have settled into the reality of competition from other countries such as Japan, Korea, Germany, and possibly China eventually, they have to face a new reality. In the future, fewer people will buy and own cars. Instead, ride-sharing services will buy a handful of cars and use self-driving vehicles to pick up and drop off passengers cheaply and conveniently. That will impact parking lots, car dealers, and the Big Three auto makers who depend on car sales to make the bulk of their income.Ride-sharing services still need cars, but the huge problem is that they’ll buy fewer of them and many people don’t want the hassle of buying and owning a car when ride-sharing services will eventually be so much easier and cheaper to use. Skip paying for a car, insurance, and maintenance and you suddenly have a huge amount of spare cash to spend on ride-sharing services with plenty of spare change left over.So when rumors of the Apple Car first appeared, people thought that meant an electric car from Apple. What that really might mean is self-driving technology from Apple. Rather than sell Apple Cars to individuals, Apple will likely sell them to fleets of ride-sharing services instead.If you think only that the future will be exactly like the past, you’d expect the Apple Car to be sold to individuals. If you believe the future will drastically change compared to the present, you’ll realize that the Apple Car will be part of the ride-sharing, self-driving revolution. Apple will likely use the Apple Car as a mobile platform for people to work and enjoy music, videos, or even e-books while they ride comfortably to and from their destinations.The future is not car ownership, and that will negatively affect the Big Three auto makers. Don’t expect General Motors to get another government bailout to survive. General Motors won’t be able to move into the self-driving, ride-sharing service industry fast enough to make a profit while still supporting a business model dependent on selling cars to individuals. Think of how Kodak failed to adapt to digital photography and that’s the likely future of the Big Three auto makers in Detroit.With companies like Apple and Tesla experimenting with self-driving cars, it’s probable that the next car revolution will take place anywhere but Detroit. The Big Three auto makers are too entrenched in selling cars to individuals. Eliminate this and the Big Three will get caught flat-footed just like they froze like a deer in the headlights when fuel-efficient Japanese imports flooded the market.If you want to see an example of clinging to the past leading straight to failure, study Sears, Blockbuster video, Nokia, the Yellow Pages, Radio Shack, and Borders Books. If you want to see an example of the future, look to any company creating products not for today, but for tomorrow. Those are the companies that will thrive.What it is: Self-driving cars are coming. The question is how will they change our lives?When rumors spread about Apple developing a car dubbed the Apple Car, many people thought it would be an electric or hydrogen fueled vehicle that Apple would sell to individuals. What’s far more likely is that Apple is looking towards a future where car ownership is largely obsolete.Cars are expensive to own and maintain. Even worse, they sit idle 95% of the time, taking up space and requiring large parking lots or garages to store them while they sit idly most of the time. That’s a tremendous waste of space. As the cost of cars continues to rise, car ownership will become less appealing, especially with the combination of ride-sharing services and self-driving cars emerges.This combination promises to keep cars moving constantly, picking up and dropping off passengers, while greatly reducing the need to own a car yourself. Without paying for a car along with insurance or gas, guess which industries are going to get hit negatively first?Car makers and car dealers will be the first to get hurt as car ownership becomes too expensive and inconvenient while ride-sharing becomes far easier and cheaper. Then expect oil companies to lose a huge amount of income from gasoline refining. Gas stations will need to shift to electric fast-chargers, but even then, what’s the point of going to a gas station to get an electric charge when electric charging stations can be placed in ordinary parking lots? Gas stations made sense when you needed a single, safe place to deposit volatile fuel. Gas stations make less sense when focusing on electric charging stations that can be placed anywhere. Toss in solar panels on the roof of your car to power it and gas stations in any form make less and less sense in the long term.Insurance companies will have fewer customers as fewer people own cars. Parking lots will disappear and become homes or parks since there’s no need to create concrete deserts for parking any more. In short, ride-sharing and self-driving cars promise to radically change the way we live. People can commute further since the time of the commute won’t be as critical since you can sleep, work, read a book, or watch a movie during your commute since you won’t have to drive yourself. Then you can relax and live further away from work.Most likely, mass transit and ride-sharing services can work together. Mass transit can take large amounts of people faster while ride-sharing can get people to those mass transit stations. Without mass transit, ride-sharing services threaten to turn our cities into crowded congested traffic jams like today, only replacing drivers with self-driving cars, which is no solution at all.'}},\n",
