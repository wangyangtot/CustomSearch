      "GAINESVILLE, FL – Scientists at the University of Florida have successfully cloned a dinosaur, a spokesman from the university said yesterday.GAINESVILLE, FL – Scientists at the University of Florida have successfully cloned a dinosaur, a spokesman from the university said yesterday.The dinosaur, a baby Apatosaurus nicknamed “Spot,” is currently being incubated at the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine.The scientists extracted DNA from preserved Apatosaurus fossils, which were on display at the university’s museum of natural science. Once the DNA was harvested, scientists injected it into a fertile ostrich womb.“Ostriches share a lot of genetic traits with dinosaurs,” said Dr. Norman Trudell, a biology professor at UF and the project’s leading scientist. “Their eggshell microstructures are almost identical to those of the Apatosaurus. That’s why the cloning worked so perfectly.”Those in the scientific community say the dinosaur cloning – the first ever of its kind – is a milestone for genetic engineering.“I used to think this kind of thing could only happen in the movies,” said Dr. Sven Bjornsen, a UF chemistry professor. “But we’re making it happen right here in our lab. It’s astounding.”The cloning attracted the attention of a wide variety of animal rights activists and religious groups. They claim that animal cloning is unethical and immoral.PETA President Ingrid E. Newkirk criticized the scientists for performing potentially life threatening threats on a new species.“These scientists brought an animal from the Jurassic age back to life – just to watch it suffer!” she said.But Dr. Trudell doesn’t seem to be bothered by the activists’ quibbling. He says that the opportunities afforded by dinosaur cloning are endless.Within ten years, we could repopulate the world with dinosaurs,” he said. “We could harvest them for civic service, law enforcement, or even mass transportation.”“Imagine riding to work on a dinosaur,” he continued. “Wouldn’t that be incredible?”As of press time, the dinosaur is in stable condition. Scientists plan to run more tests on him today.\n",

      "StorylineIn the near future, cloning is now technically advanced, but human cloning is still illegal. Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) returns home after working with his friend Hank Morgan (Rapaport), only to find a clone of himself with his family. Before he has chance to find out the truth, he is attacked by a group who want him dead. Adam must escape and find out the truth from the creator of the clones, Michael Drucker (Goldwyn). Adam knows for sure he couldn't have been cloned, but isn't ready for what he's about to hear. Written by\n",

Since they are selling the dogs to rich people, though, it seems likely they would make whatever people are willing to buy, and if that means the dogs need a special diet, then so be it. See more »Frequently Asked QuestionsUser ReviewsI recently had the pleasure of teaching the wonders of film criticism to an English composition class at Marietta College in Marietta, Ohio. The experience was enjoyable, and the class posed a number of questions. One of the more interesting questions concerned the films I had seen that I believed had potential, but ultimately failed in execution. While I have seen a number of films that fit into this category, I couldn't think of a decent example. This was because I hadn't seen \"The 6th Day\" yet. What could have been an interesting and exciting look at the evils of cloning was a \"B\" grade action film at best, despite an above-par script and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better roles to date.The film's premise is heavily based in TRUE science fiction; that is, fiction having its basis in scientific truth, using projections of the future to fully examine some aspect of our society. Sorry to go into such an elaborate definition, but I believe a lot of stuff gets swept into the category of science fiction simply because it has a robot, or takes place in outer space. But I digress.This fictional reality here deals with cloning. In the film, which takes place in the \"near future,\" cloning is an every-day practice, but only with pets and animals. Cloning people has been outlawed, as the original human cloning project went horribly wrong. Schwarzenegger plays Adam Gibson, a decent family man and helicopter pilot chartered to fly Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn), a rich businessman who owns Replacement Technologies. This corporation is at the height of cloning technology, running everything from a fish cloning company to help repopulate the oceans, to \"RePet,\" a company that clones dead family pets. There's even a rumor that the company's head doctor (Robert Duvall) is experimenting with illegal human cloning. Something goes terribly wrong on Drucker's first flight, and before he knows, Gibson discovers he has been cloned. Its up to him to discover the secret controversy, and get his life back.With this premise, the film is wide open to make many social observations, and does so very well, on occasion. Much of the legalities concerning cloning, as well as the ethical concerns, are discussed and examined by the characters. Even though the technology exists in the future, it is not widely accepted. Some of these observations are stated with all the eloquence you could expect from an Arnold/action film, but others are done so subtly, and surprisingly, with biting humor. Much of the concept of \"RePet\" is quite amusing.However, if science fiction is the film's basis, lame action sequences are its filler. In between these intriguing dialogues are shoddy, cookie-cutter action scenes one should expect from a made for TV film. No matter if it's a car chase, a laser gun shoot-out, or a helicopter battle, it all feels very dull. It's not that I'm knocking these things, because they have to appear in action film; I just wish they were done well. Ultimately, the action suffers from a lack of creativity, which ironically, is where the rest of the script excels.And one can't blame Arnold for not trying, as he is both charming and believable in his part. His is a performance with a surprising level of humanity, especially in scenes where he's going about his daily life. One almost forgets he's an action star and begins to take him a little seriously. But don't worry, after the first half-hour he's picked up a laser gun and is fighting and one-lining his way to the climax.I guess my one qualm with \"The 6th Day\" is its failed potential: with some better action sequences (like those found in \"The Matrix\"), this could have been a very decent film, one I would be sending you to right away. Instead, it's simply a wait-for-video flick, and by my guess, that wait won't be long.59 of 85 people found this review helpful.\n",

There is a ton of misinformation (and outright lies) promoted by lobbyists for those groups, and, not surprisingly, members of the public who are largely informed on scientific topics by popular culture are likely to have opinions about biotechnology that are based on emotional appeals and its sensationalist depiction in the movies than on careful analysis of the facts.

Over 50 brushes are right at your fingertips, along with numerous color palette options and tools that get assigned to your right button click to further streamline your artist workflow.Sketckbook. TwistedBrush works much like a real sketchbook. When you start TwistedBrush it is like opening your sketchbook, it is immediately ready to draw or paint on your page. When you're done with a page you turn to the the next page. You never need to manually save your work. But of course you can export your pictures to any number of the standard image formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, TGA, TIFF, GIF, etc.Page Explorer. Like a unlimited supply of sketchbooks, TwistedBrush keeps your pages stored in books. Up to 500 pages per book and an unlimited number of books means you'll never run out of paper! The Page Explorer makes it easy to view and reorganize your pages in your sketchbooks. Even assign a name to your sketch book if you like.Select Brushes. In any digital painting program the core of the system is in the brushes. Therefore easy access to the brushes is key. In TwistedBrush there are over 2000 brushes included with more added all the time. With the brush shortcut system your favorite brushes are always ready for you.Editing ArtSets. It is easy to create your own brushes and then store them into your own ArtSets. All the tools used by the creators of TwistedBrush to create brushes and ArtSets are included. You can even create your own collections of brushes easily by entering the ArtSet build mode and selecting brushes from other ArtSets. Then if you like, make these your shortcuts with a press of a button.Select Colors. Color selections are plentitful with the included color palettes. Additionally you can tweak selected colors, create your own palettes, select colors from your picture, from a reference image, the scratch layer or even the trace source image. Dynamic palettes also aid in color selections, allowing you to pick from the history of colors used or hue ranges from your currently selected color.Tools. All the tools you expect are available from the tool bar. When you have a tool selected it is activated with the right mouse (stylus) click. This means your drawing brush is always available and you never need to reselect your brush to start painting again. The tools you expect are here, eye dropper, cropping, moving, line, box, ellipse, flood fill, gradiant, masking tools, text, drawing guides, brush rotate, brush cleaner etc.Layers. TwistedBrush includes an advanced system called Layers. With layers you can split your work into transparent layers that sit on top on each others and allow for incredible editing and adjustment options even at the end stages of your painting. A wide range of layer blending modes exist including many not available in any other painting program.Paper Textures. Use paper textures while you draw to give the feel and look of textured paper and canvas. Over 70 different surface textures are included.Masks. Masks are the artists masks you may be familiar with if you've done traditional artwork. TwistedBrush has an extensive set of masking capabilities that you'll use to protect and manipulate areas of your work. Included is a magic wand with a number of different modes for creating your masks. Or use a common shape or one of the many masking brushes to create exactly the mask you need.Filters. A filter allows for processing the image all at once. TwistedBrush includes the full range of image processing filters ready to use.Tracing Paper. The tracing paper feature gives you the ability to turn your canvas into tracing paper so that you can see a reference image below it for use as a drawing guide. This is invaluable for many types of work.Cloning. Cloning, taking image data from somewhere else and placing it into your painting, that is cloning. The source image for the TwistedBrush cloning brushes can be a different image or from another area of your current picture. The cloners can be used to render a photo as a artist drawing, or to touch-up a photo or do many things in-between.Scripts. With scripts you can record your painting actions and play them back, recreating your painting from scratch. This has value for trying out different \"what-if\" scenarios, for teaching pusposes, for animation production when used with the AVI saving option or just for entertainment.Pattern Brushes. There are a number of ArtSets that contain Pattern brushes. These brushes paint a pattern on your canvas as you paint. Adjust the size the pattern with the density slider. Categories of patterns include, surface, materials, nature and others.Brush Shapes. Most any brush in TwistedBrush can be further enhanced with a shape.Drawing Guides. Drawing guides are a visual aid that appears over your canvas to help you with perspective, distances, and general construction of your artwork. A large number of different drawing guides are included.Image Brushes. Image brushes are powerful tools for both recreating the flow and feel of working with natural media but also for allowing for extraordinary painting effects. The Image Brushes : Basic ArtSet includes the brushes you need that when used in combination of captured images give you an unlimited supply of brushes.Image Warp. When using the Image Warp tool you will be pulling, pushing, pinching, and stretching your image as if it was make of rubber or putty. These tools at the extreme case can be fun for wildly adjusting a photo as shown here. But used with more finese they are invaluble for making minor adjustments to your photos or artwork saving you countless hours or re-working in more labor intensive ways.\n",

      "I'm a noob at all this molecular stuff so I'm hoping you all can help a guy out.I ran a PCR today to amplify some genomic DNA that I will be cloning into a plasmid and transforming into some chemically competent E. coli cells.I was wondering what I should run as a negative control? I know if the cloning works the plasmid ligates and an antibiotic resistant gene on the plasmid starts to be expressed. If E. coli cells take up the plasmid they will obviously grow on the antibiotic plates I made. What can I run as a negative control to ensure the cells actually took up the plasmid and didn't just spontaneously mutate and ligate and express the antibiotic resistance??The proper way to make negative control is to set up a ligation of your digested vector with water (or TE buffer/elution buffer you are using) in place of insert DNA and use that ligation as negative control in transformation. That gives you an idea of the background (self-ligated vector/contamination) present in your experiment.What Aelesawe wrote is completely wrong. What Jackbean suggested (transform using water in place of vector) would be valid negative control, but essentially useless and uninformative - unless your antibiotic does not work anymore. The other suggestion - transformation using wrong plasmid (another antibiotic resistance) - is also wrong and has no value.\n",

      "Wednesday, April 15, 2009Back in February 2003 bioethicist Gregory Stock gave a TED talk where he speculates that biotechnology - particularly genetic engineering and individually tailored personalized medicine - will ultimately \"drive\" our evolution:He thinks the human genome project was the first step in revolutionizing medicine, unravel the aging process, allow us to modulate our emotions, and generally improve human life. He thinks human cloning - \"birth of a delayed identical twin\" - will happen in 5 or 10 years, and be \"no big deal\". All of that seems pretty straightforward.*Anyway, he then goes on to what I would consider the very speculative part of his thesis: embryo selection and genetic engineering that will drive human evolution. He talks about selecting embryos that don't have the risk of manic depression, and screening for a desired personalities, which ignore the role of the environment, in addition to our genes.Even more speculatively, he thinks that the technological solution to introducing genetic changes in our offspring will be the development of an extra artificial chromosome that can be used \"program\" parents' genetic preferences in their offspring. It's not clear to me how that would work exactly - adding new genes won't necessarily override the genetic program that's already present. If both parents are brown-eyed, it's unlikely that simply adding new DNA sequences will override the genetic code in their offspring that drives the synthesis of brown eye pigment. The problem becomes even more difficult when a trait is affected by many genes.And it's not clear to me how genetic modification, which he notes will likely be reserved for the wealthy, will drive human evolution in any meaningful way if the majority of humans don't have access to the technology. How will such changes spread in the population when parents with different numbers of chromosomes often produce infertile offspring? PerhIt's worth nothing the pace of biotechnological development is very difficult to predict. Back in 1998, Stock claimed that human germline engineering \"will be a realistic option within a decade or so.\" Here we are, more than a decade later, and I don't see human germline engineering becoming an option in the immediate future, both for technical and ethical reasons.* Except for the \"no big deal\" part - some people still think hormonal birth control is a big evil deal, and that's been around for nearly 50 years. In vitro fertilization also has loud detractors. I doubt the people who are against control of human reproduction today will quickly jump on the cloning bandwagon. He does note that some people will be against human genetic engineering for religious, ethical or other reasons. I suppose the question is whether those people will have a significant effect on the adoption of the technology.Yeah, heard this before. The fact is that it is the environment that drives evolution. We can tinker with the human genome or radically change it - like we messed about with dogs and other domestic animals through selective breeding - and for a while it will seem as if we're actually shaping our destiny. Then the climate will change, or a new predator will emerge (like a virus, say) and Nature will pick who survives and who gets to breed and who doesn't.As long as we dominate our environment we can control what we become - somewhat - but we won't be controlling it forever, or even for very much longer the way things are going.You write here often enough to make it clear that you know about biology - enough, certainly, to understand that evolution occurs over geologic time frames.Given the understanding that \"natural\" evolution occurs over geologic time, do you really think that the ability to create custom genotypes *within a single generation* isn't going to accrue over geologic time to play the single most important role in genetic change? It's easily going to overwhelm genetic drift, selection, and every other natural mechanism of evolution (if one cares to tease them apart; obviously all of these things would act in concert and in response to one another).Even if only the world's richest 1% of the population engages in this, if they do so every generation combined with propagation of their offspring's genetics, I think it's self-evident how this would drive evolution over the millenia.It's quite possible that messing about with our genes will produce changes that will survive over long periods. We can even make very widespread changes and make them persist for as long as we have a society capable of doing so. But only changes that offer a reproductive benefit will spread naturally and widely in the human population.Cosmetic changes, changes to lengevity, changes to intelligence, improved disease resistance, and so on may have little or no long term benefit to the species and will eventually disappear. Some, like longevity, may actually be detrimental or may be quickly out-competed by shorter-lived but faster-breeding varieties.It may well be that changes will persist, certainly in the short term we can expect some interesting variants, but I think the hype about how this will 'change the course of human evolution' is overblown.When people act as the primary force for selection, you can drive rapid change. Look at domestic dogs. When that period is over (as it will be one day) the environment takes over again. The Australian wild dog, the dingo, was moved a long way from its original wolf ancestors by human breeders and then left to nature's care again. Perhaps we all have a dingo future ahead of us instead of a wolf future.About Biology in Science FictionScience fiction isn't just about rocket ships and ray guns.
